# NER-medical-text

This project is  to develop a named entity recognition (NER) model to identity medical entities such as diseases, symptoms, treatments in the unstructured medical text written in natural language. With the digitization of the medical records, the number of electronic health records in the form of unstructured medical text that contain rich information is increasing day by day and natural language processing techniques can be leveraged to extract such rich Information from the unstructured data.
